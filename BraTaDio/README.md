### MAIN README
- Please execute 'install_packages.py' BEFORE running this script
- when done with program, please click 'Abort' button instead of closing window
    - can cause terminal to freeze sometimes if just closing windows
- ensure sheets are in the 'raw_data' folder
    - OR specify file directory in gui
- consistency in data column placement and naming is required, however columns will be renamed
- if error occurs, it will be displayed in the terminal
- if uncaught error occurs, please notify developer asap and describe what was done to reproduce
- specify in GUI:
    - file name (with exetension)
    - file path (if not in predefined raw_data directory)
    - indicate if new clean data file should be created
    - if plotting clean data, indicate baseline t0 and tf
    - CLICK SUBMIT FILE INFO
    - indicate which channels to plot for raw/clean data
    - indicate which special plot options
    - change scale of time if applicable
    - change file format if applicable

- IF USING SPYDER
    - by default, plt will show plots in console box and span selector will not work
    - follow these steps to make selection plots open in new window:
        Tools > Preferences > IPython console > Graphics > Graphics Backend > Apply & OK
    - Also on line 15 in analyze.py there is code that reads 'matplotlib.use('TkAgg')'
        - for use with spyder change 'TkAgg' to just 'Agg'

- For interactive plot:
    - for whichever overtone is to be analyzed in the interactive plot, 
    ensure that that overtone is selected in the baseline corrected data section as well, as it relies on the cleaned data processing done there
    - indicate which overtone will be analyzed
    - selected range is displayed in right side of figure, and data points written to files in selected_ranges folder for sauerbray equation, and statistical calculations written for linear regression modeling
    - if analyzing new data file, be sure to clear range data selections via the button in column 4 before making new selections
    - save multiple ranges
        - if interactive plot selected, new column opens
        - new column will show text entry to indiciate which range is being selected
        - input and confirm the range BEFORE making selection in the plot window
        - later analysis will use the range and file src for grouping and averaging data
        - input from entry box will correlate to which file for which range is being selected
    - when making selection in graph that already has data from that section, will overwrite data from ONLY that section
        - i.e. if you select data for range 'x' in file 'data1.csv', but a selection for that was already made and data is already there,
        even if there are other ranges in the file, only data for range 'x' file 'data1.csv' will be overwritten,
        and data for range 'y' in 'data1.csv' and range 'x' in 'data2.csv' will remain untouched
    - no matter which overtone is analyzed, the range selected there will apply to ALL overtones for statistical analysis
    - to run the statistical analysis, click the button in the smaller window where the range was indicated, after all desired range selections are made, and after indicating to use theoretical or calibration/experimental values required in analysis
        - indicating calibration/exerimental values will require additional input as specified in the application window
    
- For linear Analysis
    - make sure that all frequencies desired to be in the linear regression, are selected in the 'baseline corrected data' section
    - selections from interactive plot are calculated and will be exported to a csv file that are then used in the 'lin_reg.py' script

- For Sauerbrey equation
    - 1 plot per overtone per range selected will be generated
        - i.e. if you make a selection for range x and one for range y, and you have selected frequency overtones 3, 5, and 7, you will get a plot for range x overtone 3, range y overtone 3, range x overtone 5, and so on
    - color map scheme for Sauerbray plots will match color map of baseline corrected data plots
    - equation being applied for Sauerbray is Dm = -C * (Df/n) where Df is an individual change in frequency point in the range selected, n is the corresponding overtone of that point, and C is either experimentally calculated, or the theoretical value 17.7 as chosen in the window

### DATA ANALYSIS README

- sends user input info to 'analyze.py' for processing
- opens defined data file and reads it into a dataframe
- renames columns as dictated below in Variable Declarations section
- checks which_plot to determine which channels are being analyzed, and adds to lists accordingly
- plots are frequencies and dissipations of each channel specified in 'main.py'
- if overwrite file selected, will create a copy of the data file with the baseline corrected points

Baseline Corrected Data:
    - find average resonant frequency of baseline, and lowers curve by that amount
    - removes points before start of baseline

Plot Options:
- plots raw data individually as specified in gui
- option for multi axis plot with change in frequency and dissipation vs time
- option to normalize data by dividing frequency by its respective overtone
- option to plot change in dissipation vs change in frequency
- option to change scale of x axis (time) to minutes, hours, or remain at seconds
- option to change saved figure file formats (png (default), tiff, pdf)

Interactive Plot:
- SPECIFY AND CONFIRM RANGE BEFORE MAKING SELECTION
- option for interactive plot that opens figure of selected overtone to further analyze
    - can select a range of points of plot to zoom in and save to file for later
    - interactive plot range will be used to specify statistical data for linear analysis
    - user indicates what range being selected, that range and the file containing current data,
    are used to group ranges for analysis


--------------------------------------------------------------


### LINEAR REGRESSION README

- Data for this script is statistical data curated from the raw input data acquired in 'main.py'
    - see README there for more information

- For italicized variables to work, please install a LaTex distribution (like https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html)

- script begins with various statistical data from 'all_stats_rf/dis.csv'
- For peak frequency values needed for calculation, enter values into 'calibration_peak_frequencies.txt'
    - otherwise indicate in GUI to use theoretical values, theoretical values will be used

- LINEAR REGRESSION
    - x axis is the overtone times its corresponding average change in frequency (n*Df)
        - grabs the average Df values and multiplies each by its respective overtone
        - also grabs the x_err, in this case just the std_dev of the mean
    - y axis is the bandwidth shift Î“ of each overtone (f*Dd)/2
        - grabs average peak frequency and average change in dissipation values from calibration/theoretical data, and stats csv respectively
            - note, frequency here refers to NOT baseline corrected frequency as it does in the x axis
        - calculates bandwidth defined above
        - propogates error of this calculation
    - for x and y, values are grouped by ranges, and then data sources
        - values are averaged across multiple experimental data sets, based on the range
        - these averages are also propogated and the error calculated becomes the error bars in the plot
    - plots the values with error bars and shows equation with slope
    - NEED FORMULAS FOR Calculates G prime and JF (frequency dependent shear film compliance)

    - for bandwidth calculation, only use fundamental overtone peak frequency for all overtones

## ATTENTION:
If you wish to have greek letters italicized, latex is required to be installed on your system
if it is not, please comment out the 2 lines below

### WIP

bug fixes:

format changes:

features:
- make modeling functions work for multiple ranges selected
- integrate commented out sauerbrey code to find the mass both ways

- sauerbrey mass overtone/linear fit
- OPTION TO plot all selected overtones together
- viscoelastic film modeling
- gordon-kanazawa

publication/documentation: 
- more explicit library acknowledgement sections
- instructions on adding more files to format

optimizations/refactoring: 
- only rerun calculations if changes in ui made
- have a requirements to list install dependencies that way
- remove unnecessary prints
- check data dir for existing file conversion
- make sauerbrey and avg df work for multiple ranges
- error messages become window popups
    - like when trying to submit with selections that there are no data for
    - have all exceptions be custom exception classes that generate a popup window with the err msg
- document and comment the hell out of the code
- remove latex features
- refactor analyze() to put each opt into its own function

waiting on data: 
- plot calibration values from data against overtone
    - calibration values come from the flatlining of points that we normally removed before the baseline
    - will be receiving more data soon with this air stabilization
    - interactive plot for RAW data to select the pre baseline baseline
    - bring up new window to enter range selections for each baseline (considering Bernardo's temperature jumps)

- calibration data from file option will need file formatting akin to experimental data formatting done in 'format_file.py' 

- qsense will need option to add calibration freqs to values because qsense records just change in frequency, qcmi and open qcm next record actual frequency
    - prompt user to put absolute frequencies of measured overtones into separate file, than in formatting script add those to each of the delta freq values


### CHANGE LOG
6/15
- fix sauerbrey saving ranges
- reimplement old sauerbrey eqn
- get sauerbrey and avgs to work with mult ranges
- implement saving of those outputs to a csv file

6/14
- added capability to enter time range selection in interactive plot
    - set TkAgg as backend for span selector window generation to allow for tkinter entry fields
    - text entry has a focus in/out handler for temporary text
    - update_text and onselect communicate with eachother
        - if using span selector, text field is updated with xmin,xmax values
        - if using text field, spans are set to match the entered values
    - added update text function to perform all the same tasks as the onselect function
    - refactored code so the above tasks are done in a separate function that onselect and update text both call
        - split into 2 functions, one to update plot and one to calc and save stat data
- thin film in liquid records output data used for plots into csv file "thin_film_liquid_output.csv"
- thin film in air records output data used for plots into csv file "thin_film_air_output.csv"

- Sauerbrey now has 2 methods of calculations
    - current way takes average Df from rf_stats and fits linear function to those values, multiplying slope by a theoretical or calculated C
    - additional way is being reimplemented where full freq range data is saved and picked up by sauerbrey function, and mass is plotted as a function of time by multiplying each df point by C

- bug fix input file selection not being saved
- updated readme for spyder users to make a modification to code

6/8
- fixed bug where axis weren't being labelled and no formatting was ocurring except for the last generated figure
    - setup_plot() now gets the passed in figure's number and selects it
    - figure saving now occurs outside of setup plot
- fixed bug where plot format options were only grabbed when restarting software
- replaced fundamental with 1st everywhere by altering the ordinal function
- changed color scheme of multiaxis to use the same color mapping of overtones as other plots
    - to help differentiate between freq and dis, freq uses right side up trianges, and dis uses upside down triangles
- modeling window opens from a separate button in column 4 rather than with the int plot checkbox
    - replaced destroy model window with test model window to check if it's already open when clicking button to not open duplicate windows

6/7
- refactor, made plot_customs a global variable since it is called in so many different functions
- refactor, all plots are named figure/axis objects, instead of using plt.figure(#) selecting the figure to modify before modifications are made. This is much more explicit and easy to follow rather than keeping track of which number belongs to which figure
    - adjust setup_plot functions accordingly
- sauerbrey report to 1 decimal


6/6
- fixed bug where if int plot in col 4 was checked, checking and unchecking other items in that column would open the model window 
- fixed bug with temperature plot time scale, changing units of time generated incorrect figures. temp df was in for loop of freq/dis analysis repeatedly subtracting baseline start and divisor
- adjusted multiaxis plot legend to report just the ordinal overtone number
- y axis labels in visualizations now show Df_n instead of just Df
    - adjustment made also to int plot and model plots
- refactored generate_interactive_plot() condensing code that chooses user specified overtone for visualizations
- changed units of dissipation linear fit in int plot to 1/{timescale}
- bug fix where units int plot linear fit were only reporting first letter (i.e. min was only showing m)
    - in main changed radio handler for time scale to set var to s, min, or hr, instead of just s, m, h and adjusting later
    - refactored code to accommodate this change
- raw plots now combined into 1 plot for all freq overtones and one for all dis overtones


6/5
- when selecting file, there is now a button to select which opens windows file explorer for user to select their file
    - removed code that called for separate file name and file path vars, replacing it with input.file which is simply the path/name.ext, vars that need just one of those are split as needed
    - removed file name and directory entries and corresponding handlers for them
    - refactored format_file.py to account for variable restructuring

- visualization plots now show when f is normalized in the axis label
- refactor s.t. normalized freq plot is not a separate chunk of code, rather just choosing labels for regular freq plot

- multiaxis plots now save all plots into one figure instead of separate for each overtone
- bug fix: legend placement was determined before all overtones plotted so it was misplaced
- bug fix: modeling plots were normalized when they shouldn't be
    - added unnormalized_df that is just a copy of the baseline shifted data_df but remultiplying the overtone ordinal value

- plot options put label that states options are saved even when closing software
- change asterisks to a dot
- nDf should be n * Df (dot not asterisk)
- thin film analysis y axis put proper fractions for labels
- hard coded to load qcmi.txt initially to minimize time takes for testing (will be removed on release)
- hard coded baseline time values for same purpose
- dis vs freq plot cleaned up legend
- fixed bug in multiaxis plot, now correctly save figure with user spec'd format
- fixed bug where all options in col 4 were calling destroy model window even when model window wasn't opened

- created new csv file in 'res' folder with theoretical frequency values
- added std dev to calibration data range selection
- updated calibration_frequencies function to grab frequencies from calibration data file
- adjusted prepare stats file function to have file path in name instead of hardcoding path, so can save calibration ranges to different folder than stats ranges
- bug fix, calibration/theoretical val radio buttons in modeling were not actually being sent properly to modeling functions, now that var is sent directly to function instead of via input object
- added button to clear old frequency data from selections in calibration_data.csv

- theoretical/calibration values option selection moved to column 1
- calibration menu option moved to nested option within column 1
- restructured theoretical/calibration selection as follows:
    - first prompted to use either theoretical or calibration values
        - if using theoretical, input object is updated and user can continue
        - if calibration selected, input object updated and user is then prompted with option to use from file or make selections
            - if file option selected, label informs user to copy values into file in calibration_data folder
            - if selections option selected, calibration menu button made available

- lower case dissipation for equation model plots
